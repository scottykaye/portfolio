# scottykaye's NextJS portfolio
This repo is a space for me to:
- Blog my recent engineering thoughts
- Experiment with new technologies and ideas
- Build cool accessible UI
- Inspire others to be better versions of themselves

### To load dev
Using yarn berry 😎. @Theo hates it and hates me for it. _(Will update to bun soon though!)_

Run `yarn && yarn dev`

### Feel free to reach out to me!
Feel free to reach out to me on any medium to chat! I am always down for coffee ☕︎ and talk frontend!  _(or if you really want powerlifting)_
