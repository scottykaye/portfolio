Early in my career, my focus was on HTML & CSS. When I was first introduced to
Tailwind I was initially skeptical. However, using it in different projects, I
quickly realized that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

## Utility class approach

The main difference of Tailwind is the utility first approach allowing you to
leverage predefined class names directly in your code.

Tailwind‚Äôs utility first approach is a major point of contention for those who
prefer modular CSS. Initially I shared similar feelings. There is a sense of
freedom that comes with creating modular styles by separating concerns. And lets
face it, we are creatures of habit. Most people get paralyzed by this difference
in approach and don't see past this point to understand how its one of Tailwinds
greatest strengths.

## The benefits of a utility class approach

Tailwind classes are tied to single or in some cases multiple CSS declarations.
This allows the style sheet to only record declarations once.

For example, with modular styles you will declare declarations like
`display: flex` or `margin: 1rem` repeatedly in classes where using Tailwind,
declarations are recorded once in your style sheet reducing the overall size of
the styles you need to bundle to the browser.

```css
/* Tailwind - These two classes are reused every time you use these CSS declarations */
.m-4 {
  margin: 1rem;
}
.flex {
  display: flex;
}

/* Modular - We will find ourselves writing declarations more than once */
.MyClass {
  display: flex;
  margin: 1rem;
}

.MyOtherClass {
  flex-direction: column;
  /* repeated declarations: */
  display: flex;
  margin: 1rem;
}
```

Tailwind does not repeat, therefore reducing bloated files and creating leaner
style sheets. We can do more while writing less allowing us to move faster
reducing the concern for how many styles we are using.

Over time enterprise applications are often susceptible to unwieldy style sheets
and become to cumbersome to edit. Tailwind removes this problem by keeping
styles coupled directly with the code.

Another point of contention is removing the need to handle CSS specificity.
Tailwind will handle this for you and community solutions like
[tailwind-merge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-merge) that allow you to
focus on building your application and removing this complexity.

It's important to remember Tailwind is still CSS. If you want to write some code
using specificity and custom classes you can and in some cases you should. I do
this often, like when I deal with pseudo hover and focus classes on parent
elements. I also frequently leverage the layer utilities function to create
custom classes like styles for scrollbars.

Tailwind is merely providing you a framework of basic specificity to work off of
and reduces complexity to make it easier for you and multiple others to work on
an application together and be successful.

This is what good frameworks do, help you focus on the development of your
application and alleviate the overhead of solving scalability and performance
issues.

## Consistency

The utility first approach makes it easier for users to adhere to standards with
themes and systems. By providing classes out of the box, it is more likely that
users of your system will stick to the conventions set by the team. When given
the chance to write a new style sheet, engineers are more likely to try to solve
a problem using unique values or different units and not sticking to variables
and best practices.

Providing class names for engineers who may be less confident with CSS who may
need to set layout or make small CSS tweaks, are more likely to be successful
when they don't have to understand the entire ecosystem of style sheets to get
their feature across the finish line.

Tailwind still provides flexibility to break out of any utility class and
provide custom declarations:

```jsx
<div className="grid grid-cols-[200px,1fr]">...</div>
```

## Performance

Where Tailwind shines most bright is its ability to do the hard parts of
performance for you. Without Tailwind traditionally when running your
application against performance metrics, (especially large enterprise
applications) you will likely have to determine which CSS is critical or above
the fold. Typically teams have to create a solution to inline styles in the
`<head/>` of the page and immediately hydrate the critical CSS. All of this is
taken care of for you in Tailwind.

By default purging is built into Tailwind out of the box, further reducing the
need to manually curate styles that need to be purged. Tailwind will purge all
styles used in its `base`, `components` and `utilities` layers.

## Customization

Tailwind supports endless customization, you can easily customize your
configuration:

- Specify files that use Tailwind
- Themes
- Screen sizes
- Spacing
- Colors
- Typography
- Countless plugins
- Reusable presets

Anything you can do in CSS you can configure Tailwind to handle.

## Prototyping

It is a tool that allows you to more rapidly prototype because you're given some
presets that allow you to hit the ground running right away. Tailwind is great
for prototyping but it is not bootstrap. Yes it comes out of the box
unopinionated but the ability to customize it so heavily is there for you to
form opinions on how the application should leverage it.

## Large community and ecosystem

Tailwind currently has over 82K stars on GitHub and is actively growing. There's
a huge community of support around this styling framework with many trusted
contributors, active [plugins](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/plugins) and
maintainers.

It's a first class citizen for Next.js which also has a large community around
it, so expect Tailwind to continue to grow and be adopted as a framework.

### Tailwind complaints

The biggest argument and longest running joke against Tailwind are the super
long class names that can be created.

There are many techniques and approaches to managing this:

- Using a [clsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/clsx) function to create arrays
  of strings to manage organization.
- Creating constants and use them in your class names or clsx functions.
- Using sorting mechanisms to reduce friction of class name changes.

This problem affords you the opportunity to create a hierarchy to organize class
names for your application and systems.

## Takeaways

Yes, Tailwind does take some of the hardest parts of CSS and simplify them. CSS
specs are becoming easier and easier to use and we tend to praise these newer
solutions like flex, grid, etc. We should praise frameworks like Tailwind the
same.

Being a successful developer or engineer requires a willingness to try new
things. Embrace change and new tools by trying them out for a period of time in
applications or side projects and form opinions on the best use cases for
different tools.

For me currently, I've been using Tailwind CSS whenever I spin up a new app. üòÅ
I do still use CSS and regular styles in my quick
[Codepen's](https://codepen.io/scottykaye) and when Tailwind might not have a
class out of the box for prototyping.

Tailwind has made me faster and more efficient by having less overhead to
maintain and allows me to have an impact on applications faster in my day to
day.
